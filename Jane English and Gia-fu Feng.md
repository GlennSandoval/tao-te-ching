# Lao Tsu and Taoism

Lao Tsu, an older contemporary of Confucius, was  
keeper of the imperial archives at Loyang in the  
province of Honan in the sixth century B.C. All his  
life he taught that "The Tao that can be told is not  
the eternal Tao"; but, according to ancient legend,  
as he was riding off into the desert to die - sick at  
heart at the ways of men - he was persuaded by a  
gatekeeper in northwestern China to write down his  
teaching for posterity.  
   The essence of Taoism is contained in the eighty-  
one chapters of the book - roughly 5,000 words -  
which have for 2,500 years provided one of the  
major underlying influences in Chinese thought  
and culture, emerging also in proverbs and folklore.  
Whereas Confucianism is concerned with day-to-  
day rules of conduct, Taoism is concerned with a  
more spiritual level of being.  

# ONE

The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the beginning of heaven and earth.
The named is the mother of ten thousand things.
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.
Ever desiring, one can see the manifestations.
These two spring from the same source but differ in name;
  this appears as darkness.
Darkness within darkness.
The gate to all mystery.

# TWO

Under heaven all can see beauty as beauty only because there is ugliness.
All can know good as good only because there is evil.

Therefore having and not having arise together.
Difficult and easy complement each other.
Long and short contrast each other;
High and low rest upon each other;
Voice and sound harmonize each other;
Front and back follow one another.

Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking.
The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease,
Creating, yet not possessing,
Working, yet not taking credit.
Work is done, then forgotten.
Therefore it lasts forever.

# THREE

Not exalting the gifted prevents quarreling. 
Not collecting treasures prevents stealing.
Not seeing desirable things prevents confusion of the heart.

The wise therefore rule by emptying hearts and stuffing bellies,
  by weakening ambitions and strengthening bones.
If people lack knowledge and desire,
  then intellectuals will not try to interfere.
If nothing is done, then all will be well.
